# Experiment No: 1C-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - using two values using all the relational operators
# AIM
To write a Python program for two values using all the relational operators (>,<,>=,<=,== ,!=).

# ALGORITHM
Start Assign values a = 13 and b = 33 Compare a and b using > , < , >= , <= , == , != Print the results of each comparison Stop

# PROGRAM
# Reg.No-212223060113
# Name-Karnatam Bindu
```
a = 13
b = 33
# a > b is False
print(a > b)
# a < b is True
print(a < b)
# a == b is False
print(a == b)
# a != b is True
print(a != b)
# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)
# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)

# RESULT
Thus, the Python program for comparing two numbers using all relational operators is successfully executed and the above results are
